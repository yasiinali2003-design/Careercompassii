# Final Solution for Stuck Process 57580

## Status
Process 57580 is stuck in **Uninterruptible Wait (UE)** state in the macOS kernel. This means:
- It cannot be killed via `kill -9`
- It cannot be killed via `killall`
- The kernel is holding it waiting for I/O that never completes
- This requires **system-level intervention**

## Solution Options (in order of preference):

### Option 1: Activity Monitor (GUI) - RECOMMENDED ✅
1. Press `Cmd + Space`
2. Type "Activity Monitor" → Enter
3. Press `Cmd + F` to search
4. Type `57580` or search for `next-server`
5. Select it
6. Click **Force Quit** button (⚡ in toolbar)
7. Run `npm run dev`

### Option 2: Restart Your Mac
- This will clear ALL stuck processes
- `Cmd + Control + Power Button` → Click "Restart"
- After restart, run `npm run dev`

### Option 3: Logout and Login
- Sometimes this clears stuck processes
- Apple Menu → Log Out → Log back in
- Run `npm run dev`

## Why Terminal Can't Kill It

The process is waiting on a kernel system call that cannot be interrupted. Even `sudo kill -9` won't work because the kernel won't allow it until the I/O operation completes or fails.

## After Killing Process 57580

Once the process is gone, your server will start on port 3000 successfully:

```bash
cd /Users/yasiinali/careercompassi
npm run dev
```

You'll see:
```
✓ Ready in Xms
- Local: http://localhost:3000
```
