# ‚úÖ SESSION 1A COMPLETE: Question Mapping Review

## üìã What Was Built

I've created the foundation for your scoring system:

1. **`types.ts`** - All TypeScript interfaces for the scoring system
2. **`dimensions.ts`** - Complete mapping of all 90 questions to dimensions
3. **`cohortConfig.ts`** - UI copy and settings for each cohort

## üéØ QUESTION MAPPING SUMMARY

### **Overall Distribution (All 3 Cohorts)**

| Dimension | Questions | Percentage | Status |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Interests** | 15/30 | 50% | ‚úÖ Excellent coverage |
| **Workstyle** | 10/30 | 33% | ‚úÖ Good coverage |
| **Values** | 3/30 | 10% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited (as expected) |
| **Context** | 2/30 | 7% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited (as expected) |

### **Key Insights**

‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Strong interest differentiation (tech, creative, people, hands-on)
- Good workstyle coverage (teamwork, leadership, organization)
- Questions are clear and work well with Likert scale

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations:**
- Limited values data (only growth, impact, global)
- Limited context data (only outdoor, international)
- Will impact matching for careers where values/context are key differentiators

## üìä DETAILED BREAKDOWN BY COHORT

### **YL√ÑASTE (YLA) - 30 Questions**

**Interests (15 questions):**
- Q1: Technology (weight: 1.2) ‚≠ê High weight
- Q3: Hands-on work
- Q4: Helping people (weight: 1.2) ‚≠ê High weight
- Q5: Environment
- Q8: Creative expression (weight: 1.2) ‚≠ê High weight
- Q9: Math/Science (analytical)
- Q10: Physical hands-on
- Q12: Writing/languages
- Q13: Visual design
- Q16: History/culture
- Q18: Business/negotiation
- Q20: Business/economics
- Q21: Innovation
- Q23: Health/wellness
- Q26: Sports

**Workstyle (10 questions):**
- Q0: Teamwork
- Q2: Leadership
- Q6: Strategic planning
- Q7: Organization
- Q11: Planning/organization
- Q15: Performance/presenting
- Q19: Precision
- Q22: Motivation/coaching
- Q24: Problem-solving/analysis
- Q27: Problem-solving
- Q28: Teaching

**Values (3 questions):**
- Q14: Growth mindset
- Q25: Impact/influence
- Q29: Global/international

**Context (2 questions):**
- Q17: Outdoor work
- (Q29 could also be context)

---

### **TOISEN ASTEEN (TASO2) - 30 Questions**

**Same structure as YLA**, with age-appropriate phrasing:
- "Ryhm√§ty√∂skentely" ‚Üí "Tiimity√∂skentely ja yhteisty√∂"
- "Teknologia" ‚Üí "Teknologia ja ohjelmointi"
- "Ymp√§rist√∂nsuojelu" ‚Üí "Kest√§v√§ kehitys ja ymp√§rist√∂asiat"

**Key Difference:** More professional/career-focused language.

---

### **NUORET AIKUISET (NUORI) - 30 Questions**

**Important Difference:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Q0 asks about INDEPENDENCE** (vs. teamwork in other cohorts)
- This creates asymmetry - might need special handling

**Otherwise same structure** with adult-appropriate phrasing.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è WEIGHTING STRATEGY

Each question has a **weight (0.5 - 2.0)** based on importance:

**High Weight (1.2):**
- Technology interest (Q1 all cohorts)
- People/helping interest (Q4 all cohorts)
- Creative expression (Q8 all cohorts)

**Normal Weight (1.0):**
- Most questions

**Lower Weight (0.7-0.8):**
- Niche interests (history, culture, sports)
- Global/international (limited applicability)
- Overlapping questions

**Rationale:** Some interests are strong career differentiators (tech vs. creative vs. people), while others are supportive details.

---

## üîç KEY DECISIONS FOR YOUR REVIEW

### **Decision 1: Q29 (International Work)**
- **Current mapping:** VALUES (global)
- **Alternative:** Could be CONTEXT (work location preference)
- **Your feedback:** Is this a value ("I want global exposure") or context preference ("I'm willing to travel")?

### **Decision 2: Q0 NUORI (Independence)**
- **Issue:** YLA/TASO2 ask about teamwork, NUORI asks about independence
- **Current approach:** Different subdimensions (teamwork vs. independence)
- **Risk:** Creates asymmetry in scoring - younger cohorts can't express independence preference
- **Your feedback:** Keep as-is or should we normalize this somehow?

### **Decision 3: Weights for Niche Interests**
- **Lower weighted:** History (Q16), Sports (Q26), Writing (Q12)
- **Rationale:** Fewer careers strongly require these
- **Your feedback:** Are these weights appropriate for your 175 careers?

### **Decision 4: Values/Context Gaps**
- **Missing:** Salary importance, work-life balance, remote work, stress tolerance
- **Impact:** Can't distinguish "high-paying tech job" vs. "meaningful low-pay NGO" preferences
- **Your feedback:** Acceptable for MVP or critical gap?

## ‚úÖ WHAT YOU NEED TO REVIEW (10 minutes)

### **Quick Check:**
1. Open `dimensions.ts`
2. Scan the question mappings
3. Check if dimension assignments make sense

### **Key Questions:**
1. **Do the dimension assignments feel right?**
   - Is Q4 "Haluatko auttaa muita" an INTEREST or could it be a VALUE?
   - Is Q29 "Kansainv√§linen ty√∂" a VALUE or CONTEXT?

2. **Any glaring errors?**
   - Questions mapped to wrong dimensions?
   - Weights that seem off?

3. **Q0 NUORI issue - keep or fix?**
   - Accept asymmetry (different questions per cohort)?
   - Or should I normalize it?

4. **Are the values/context gaps acceptable for MVP?**
   - Or do we need to address them before continuing?

## üö¶ NEXT STEPS

### **If you approve:**
‚úÖ Reply: **"Looks good, proceed to Session 1B"**

I'll start Session 1B: Career Vector Generation (2-3 hours)

### **If you want changes:**
üìù Reply with specific feedback, e.g.:
- "Move Q29 to CONTEXT dimension"
- "Increase weight for Q23 (health)"
- "Fix Q0 NUORI to match other cohorts"

I'll make adjustments and re-submit for approval.

## üí° MY RECOMMENDATION

**Proceed as-is** with these notes:
1. Q0 NUORI asymmetry is fine - adults care more about independence
2. Values/context gaps are acceptable for MVP - we can iterate post-launch
3. Weights look reasonable based on career differentiation
4. Q29 as VALUES is correct - it's about aspiration, not just willingness

**But I defer to your judgment!** You know your users and careers better than I do.
