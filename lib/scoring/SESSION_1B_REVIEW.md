# ✅ SESSION 1B COMPLETE: Career Vector Generation

## 📋 What Was Built

I've generated career personality profiles for all 175 careers:

1. **`vectorGenerator.ts`** - Feature extraction logic
2. **`generateVectorsScript.js`** - Script to generate vectors from career data
3. **`careerVectors.ts`** - **175 career vectors** (108 KB)

## 🎯 CAREER VECTORS SUMMARY

### **What is a Career Vector?**

Each career now has a "personality profile" with scores (0-100%) across multiple dimensions:

**Structure:**
```typescript
{
  slug: "sairaanhoitaja",
  title: "Sairaanhoitaja",
  category: "auttaja",
  interests: {
    technology: 56%,
    people: 100%,     // Strong!
    creative: 0%,
    health: 100%,     // Strong!
    // ... etc
  },
  workstyle: {
    teamwork: 100%,   // Strong!
    leadership: 0%,
    organization: 0%,
    // ... etc
  },
  values: {
    growth: 50%,
    impact: 90%       // Strong!
  },
  context: {
    outdoor: 0%
  }
}
```

## 🔍 HOW VECTORS WERE GENERATED

### **Method: Keyword-Based Feature Extraction**

For each career, I analyzed:
1. **Title** (Finnish + English)
2. **Description**
3. **Main tasks** (what they do daily)
4. **Core skills**
5. **Tools & tech**
6. **Keywords**
7. **Category** (luova, johtaja, etc.)

### **Scoring Logic:**

**Example: Technology Interest**
- Keywords: `['teknologia', 'ohjelm', 'data', 'digital', 'ai', 'robot', 'it-', 'web']`
- Scan all career text for matches
- Normalize to 0-1 scale
- Apply category boost if relevant

**Category Boosts:**
- `auttaja` → +0.8 to people interest
- `luova` → +0.8 to creative interest
- `innovoija` → +0.7 to technology & innovation
- `rakentaja` → +0.7 to hands_on interest
- `johtaja` → +0.8 to leadership workstyle

## 📁 GENERATED FILE

**`lib/scoring/careerVectors.ts`**
- Size: **108 KB**
- Careers: **175 vectors**
- Format: TypeScript/JSON
- Functions:
  - `getCareerVector(slug)` - Get specific career
  - `getAllCareerVectors()` - Get all 175

## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### **1. Limited Values/Context Data**
- **Issue:** Only 2-3 values scores per career (growth, impact, global)
- **Why:** Limited values questions in test (Q14, Q25, Q29)
- **Impact:** Can't distinguish "high salary seeker" vs "purpose-driven"
- **Solution:** Acceptable for MVP - values/context matching will be less precise

### **2. Keyword-Based Extraction**
- **Issue:** Not as accurate as manual curation
- **Why:** Automated parsing of career descriptions
- **Impact:** Some scores might be slightly off
- **Solution:** Can manually tune specific careers later

### **3. Some Scores May Feel High/Low**
- **Example:** All categories have `technology: 56%` as baseline (keyword frequency)
- **Why:** Modern careers often mention digital tools
- **Impact:** Tech scores might not differentiate enough
- **Solution:** Relative scoring still works (96% vs 56% is clear)

## 🎯 WHAT YOU NEED TO REVIEW (15 minutes)

### **Quick Validation:**

Look at these 10 careers and check if scores feel right:

1. **Sairaanhoitaja** - High people (100%), high health (100%) ✅
2. **Data-insinööri** - High tech (100%), high analytical (100%) ✅
3. **Graafinen suunnittelija** - High creative (100%) ✅
4. **Rakennusmestari** - High hands-on (70%), high leadership (100%) ✅
5. **Projektipäällikkö** - High leadership (100%), high organization (100%) ✅

### **Questions to Consider:**

1. **Do the top interests make sense for each career?**
   - E.g., Should "Sairaanhoitaja" be 100% people-focused? ✅ Yes

2. **Are workstyle scores reasonable?**
   - E.g., Should "Projektipäällikkö" have high leadership? ✅ Yes

3. **Any glaring errors?**
   - Careers with totally wrong profiles?
   - Missing key characteristics?

4. **Acceptable for MVP?**
   - Or do we need to manually tune some careers first?

## 🚦 NEXT STEPS

### **If you approve:**
✅ Reply: **"Looks good, proceed to Session 1C"**

I'll start Session 1C: Scoring Engine + Reason Generator (2-3 hours)

### **If you want changes:**
📝 Reply with specific feedback, e.g.:
- "Sairaanhoitaja should have lower people score"
- "Data-insinööri needs higher independence"
- "Show me vectors for [specific careers]"

I'll adjust and re-generate.

---

## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Proceed as-is** with these notes:
1. Vectors capture the main characteristics well
2. Category boosts ensure proper differentiation
3. Can fine-tune specific careers later if needed
4. Relative scores (high vs medium vs low) are what matter for matching

**This is good enough for MVP!** The scoring algorithm will work well with these vectors.
