# Teacher Dashboard Implementation Guide

## Step 1: Database Setup (YOU DO THIS)

Run the SQL in your Supabase project to create the tables and policies.

### Instructions:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your CareerCompassi project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy ALL content from: `supabase-teacher-dashboard.sql`
6. Paste and click **Run**

### What Gets Created:
- ✅ `classes` table (stores class info, NO names)
- ✅ `pins` table (stores student PINs)
- ✅ `results` table (stores test results, NO names)
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ RPC functions for anonymous data access

### Security Features:
- 🔒 **No names stored** in any table
- 🔒 **No PII** (Personally Identifiable Information)
- 🔒 **RLS enabled** on all tables
- 🔒 **Public access limited** to anonymous token-based reading
- 🔒 **Teacher auth required** for management

## Step 2: Review Database Schema (BOTH OF US)

After you run the SQL, I'll show you:
- What each table does
- Why it's GDPR-compliant
- How RLS policies work
- **Then you approve before I proceed**

---

## Next Steps After Step 1:
- Step 3: API Endpoints (I'll build)
- Step 4: UI Components (I'll build)
- Step 5: Testing (You test)
- Step 6: Deployment (Both of us)

---

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Database schema created (SQL file ready)
- ✅ Crypto utils created (AES-GCM encryption)
- ⏳ Waiting for you to run SQL in Supabase

**Action Required:**
Run the SQL from `supabase-teacher-dashboard.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor, then let me know when it's done!
